				BlocBox was a project that I participated in as part of my appreticeship at Bloc.io.
				Blocbox is a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application which allows people to collect information and store it in a single place. A person can create simple documents, store images, links to websites, and collaborate with others. The web application had had all its business requirements and specifictions listed, the task at hand was to design BlocBox.

				The first phase of the project was to conduct competitive analysis and research. Competitive analysis included SWOT analysis:

				Conducting surveys, interviewing potential users, developing personas and writing user stories helped plan and define the strategy for designing this web application.
				<br/>
				The survey was created using Google Forms and was based on the following points of interest:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How our users interact with their devices</li><br/>
				<li>What they look at online</li><br/>
				<li>If they save content</li><br/>
				<li>If they write and save notes to remember things later</li><br/>
				<li>About the tools they currently use their profession</li><br/>
				<li>If they collaborate and share resources with their co-workers</li><br/>
				<li>If they use social network logins to sign up for websites their age and where they live</li><br/>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The individuals polled consisted of many types of possible users from designers to tech professionals. The results were aggregated into an excel file:

				The summary of the results was presented in a graphical format:
				<img src="images/blocBoxCase/graphs.png">
				Conclusions could easily be extracted by analyzing the graphs such as: more than half of the surveyed individuals save content some of the time, and typically bookmark items in the browser.<br/>
				The final report of survey result analysis and competitive analysis can be found: <a href="files/blocBoxPlanningPhase.pdf">here</a>
				<br/>
				User personas were created to help put a name, face and a backstory with potential users of Blocbox. Below is a sample user persona:

				Next, user stories were created for both new and returning users. Using these corresponding user flows were sketched. User flows were created using <a href="draw.io">Draw.io</a>. Sample user flows are shown below:

				There were many iterations for the sitemap seeing as a good sitemap ensures clear organization of the content. Below is the final sitemap:

				The sitemap clarified the pages needed to wireframe and design. The content of all these pages was collected.
				The low fidelity wireframes were roughly sketch out by hand as seen below:
				<img src="images/blocBoxCase/rawSketch.jpg">
				Based on these initial paper sketches, the wireframes were created using Balsamiq. Some of the wireframes are shown below:
				<img src="images/blocBoxCase/Balsamiq.jpg">
				Higher fidelity prototypes were created in Adobe Illustrator, as seen below:

				User testing was done throughout this phase to test different design decisions such as where to put the navigation:

				The design guide created can be seen below:

				The design guide included the logo that had to be created. In order to create the logo a mindmap was created to visualize related concepts and words that would influence the logo. Many different logos were created and compared:

				Finally, the following logo was chosen:

				Based on the prototypes created and the design guide the following homepage was designed:

				Later on the design guide color palette was modified and the following designs were created:

			 	Usability testing was performed using <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/">Usability Hub</a>, in particular the Five Second Test and Nav Flow Test were conducted.<br/>
			 	There were 30 reponses for the Five Second Test, the results showed that users always recognized and remembered the name and logo of Blocbox. Most agreed that the design looked professional and clean.<br/>
			 	For the Nav Flow Test, the question posed was: "How would you upload an image to your dashboard?" Based on 10 responses, the success rate was 66%, with a completion time of 18 seconds. This was lower than expected and indicated further improvement was needed.

				InVision was used to create a clickable prototype of the final designs that was showcased to the client. Throughout the research, prototyping and design phases the client was kept up to date with the progress, this ensured everyone was on the same page.
