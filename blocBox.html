				BlocBox was a project that I participated in as part of my appreticeship at Bloc.io. Blocbox is a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application which allows people to collect information and store it in a single place. A person can create simple documents, store images, links to websites and collaborate with others. The project's business requirements and specifictions were gathered: the task at hand was to <b>design</b> BlocBox.

				The first phase of the project was to conduct <b>competitive analysis and research</b>. Competitive analysis included SWOT analysis:

				Conducting <b>surveys, interviewing potential users, developing personas and writing user stories</b> helped plan and define the strategy for designing this web application.
				<br/>
				The most informative survey for this project was created using Google Forms and was based on the following points of interest:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How our users interact with their devices</li><br/>
				<li>What they look at online</li><br/>
				<li>If they save content</li><br/>
				<li>If they write and save notes to remember things later</li><br/>
				<li>What tools they currently use in their profession</li><br/>
				<li>If they collaborate and share resources with their co-workers</li><br/>
				<li>If they use social network logins to sign up for websites their age and where they live</li><br/>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The individuals polled consisted of many types of possible users from designers to tech professionals. The results were aggregated into an excel file:

				The summary of the results was presented in a graphical format:

				Conclusions could easily be extracted by analyzing the graphs. Conclusions made included: more than half of the surveyed individuals save content some of the time and typically bookmark items in the browser.<br/>
				The final report of <b>survey result analysis</b> and competitive analysis can be found: <a href="files/blocBoxPlanningPhase.pdf">here</a>

				<b>User personas</b> were created to help put a name, face and a backstory to potential users of Blocbox. Below is a sample user persona that was presented to the client:

				<b>User stories</b> were created for both new and returning users. Using these user stories, corresponding user flows were sketched. User flows were created using <a href="draw.io">Draw.io</a>. <b>Sample user flows are shown below:</b>

				After many iterations the final <b>sitemap</b> was forged. A optimal sitemap is very important seeing as a good sitemap ensures clear organization of the content. Below is the final sitemap:
				<img src="images/blocBoxCase/sitemap.jpg">
				Creating the sitemap helped clarify the pages needed to be wireframed and designed. The <b>content</b> for all these pages was collected beforehand, knowing the content that will go into the pages helped in planning the wireframes.<br/>
				The low fidelity wireframes were roughly <b>sketched out by hand</b> as seen below:
				<img src="images/blocBoxCase/rawSketch.jpg">
				Based on these initial rough paper sketches, more refined wireframes were created using <b>Balsamiq</b>. Some of the Balsamiq wireframes are shown below:
				<img src="images/blocBoxCase/Balsamiq.jpg">
				Higher fidelity prototypes were later created in <b>Adobe Illustrator</b>, as seen below:
				<img src="images/blocBoxCase/highFidelAddItems.jpg">
				<img src="images/blocBoxCase/highFidelLoginBilling.jpg">
				<b>A/B testing</b> was done throughout this wireframing phase to test different design decisions such as where to put the navigation:

				The design guide created can be seen below:
				<img src="images/blocBoxCase/designGuide.jpg">
				The <b>design guide</b> included the logo that was designed in Illustrator. In order to create the logo a mindmap was created to visualize related concepts and words that would influence the logo. Many different logos were created and compared:

				Finally, the following logo was chosen:

				Based on the prototypes created and the design guide the following homepage was designed:

				Based on <b>user and client feedback</b>, the design guide color palette was modified and the following designs were replaced the previous ones:

			 	Usability testing was performed using <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/">Usability Hub</a>, in particular the <b>Five Second Test and Nav Flow Test</b> were conducted.<br/>
			 	There were 30 reponses for the Five Second Test, the results showed that users always recognized and remembered the name and logo of Blocbox. Most agreed that the design looked professional and clean.<br/>
			 	For the Nav Flow Test, the question posed was: "How would you upload an image to your dashboard?" Based on 10 responses, the success rate was 66%, with a completion time of 18 seconds. This was lower than expected and indicated further improvement was needed.

				InVision was used to create a clickable prototype of the final designs that was showcased to the client. Throughout the research, prototyping and design phases the client was kept up to date with the progress, this ensured everyone was on the same page.
