				The client wanted a wedding website to be designed and developed from scratch in vanilla javascript, HTML and CSS. All design and UI elements, including the logo needed to be original. The wedding was a traditional indian wedding and so the color pallette chosen had to reflect the vibrance of an indian wedding.

				Development was done by myself and another developer. We worked collaboratively using GIT to power our development workflow. Particular attention was given to responsive design to ensure that the website was fully mobile compatible in both potrait and landscape orientation.
				The end result can be seen in the <a href="http://sandeepwedsrashna.com/">LIVE website</a> and in the screenshots below:
