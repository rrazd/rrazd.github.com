				The client wanted a wedding website to be designed and developed from scratch in vanilla javascript, HTML and CSS. All design and UI elements, including the logo needed to be original. The wedding was a traditional indian wedding and so the color pallette chosen had to reflect the vibrance of an indian wedding.
