<h4 id='motivation'>Motivation</h4>

<p>In third year Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo I took a course called Probability Theory and Random Processes (ECE 316). The course was by no means easy, but I found it to be immensely interesting and very useful in all applications of life. The course was taught by Professor Xie, an excellent professor. Equipped with theoretical knowledge about probability I became quite interested in the Markov model and its uses in natural language processing. <br /></p>

<h4 id='about_the_application'>About the Application</h4>

<p>I created an application called Essay Space Filler in C++, based on the Markov Model. This application generates &#8216;random&#8217; constant number of characters, enough to pass as a short paragraph. I say &#8216;random&#8217; but it isn&#8217;t truly random. In fact the output is controlled by the programmer in my loose adaptation of the Markov model. My program always outputs the one character following the current seed that has the highest probability. The way most Markov chains are implemented is, after every character that is output, it generates an entire probability distribution of possible characters and subsequently chooses one of them randomly, according to the probability distribution calculated. <br /></p>

<p>The application source code along with more details regarding the development process can be found at my <a href='https://github.com/rrazd/EssaySpaceFiller'>GitHub page.</a> It is always really awesome to be able to apply what was taught in university!</p>

<code>
Professor Dumbledore sent all the Gryffindors back to the Great Hall, where they were joined ten minutes later by the students from Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, who all looked extremely confused.
“The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough search of the castle,” Professor Dumbledore told them as Professors McGonagall and Flitwick closed all doors into the hall. “I’m afraid that, for your own safety, you will have to spend the night here. I want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and Girl in charge. Any disturbance should be reported to me immediately,” he added to Percy, who was looking immensely proud and important.
