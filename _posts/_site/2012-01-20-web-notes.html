<p>Quite recently I had the urge to create something. I gave myself a limit of three days so as to complete a project in a time sensitive environment. I knew that in order to pull of this project I had to make a plan: a visual site map is quick to make, it can be fairly detailed yet I kept mine simple so that it would be easy to change if need be.</p>

<p>To create the website I used PHP + SQL. I wanted to refine my skills in these two areas and during the rewarding journey of creating the website, I learnt a lot of new things! It&#8217;s important to note that the main objective was to LEARN! If I had wanted to create the most feature rich website in very little time, I would have used a framework.

<p>The best part was writing out the PHP logic and figuring out how to implement my ideas into code and in turn into reality! <br /> <div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>$command = &quot;select postId from &quot;.$table_name;
$result = mysql_query($command);
while ($data = mysql_fetch_object($result))
{
	print &quot;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;a href=?id=&quot;.$data-&gt;postId.&quot;&gt;Blog &quot;.$data-&gt;postId.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;;
}
print &quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;;
mysql_close($db);
print &quot;&lt;div class = blog_entry&gt;&quot;;
include(&quot;pointer.php&quot;); 
print &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;;</code>
  </pre>
</div></p>
<br />
<p>I did not use a lot of CSS for the site. The reason being that this way all the focus would remain on the user entries.</p>
