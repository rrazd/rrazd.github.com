#Mini WebNotes
<br/>

####The Start of Something New
Quite recently I had the urge to create something. I gave myself a limit of three days so as to 
complete a project in a time sensitive environment. I knew that in order to pull of this project
I had to make a plan: a visual site map is quick to make, it can be fairly detailed yet 
I kept mine simple so that it would be easy to change if need be.

####A Brief Overview of the End Product
To create the website I used PHP + SQL. I wanted to refine my skills in these two topics and during the
arduous journey that was the process of creating this website, I learn more that a few things! It's important 
to note that the main objective was to learn. If I had wanted to create the most feature rich website in very little
time I would have used a framework instead. 
I decided to make a website where a user could login to their own webspace. Once in, they have the option of:
<br/>


####1. Jotting down any quick reminders, ideas and notes. These entries are posted after the user clicks "Submit" 
<br/>
####2. Emailing and share user login details with friends so that people can comment on the entries 
<br/>
####3. Controlling who can sign-in to the webspace in order to prevent any abuse, by banning a guest's IP
<br/>
####4. Basic SQL injection protection during the login process
<br/>
####5. A minimal and sleek display of all previous entries, sorted according to date. 
<br/>
####6. A banner displaying an active countdown to the end of the current month.  

<br/>
<br/>
####The Best Part
The best part was writing out the PHP logic and figuring out how to implement my ideas into code and in turn into 
reality! The code wasn't too complex. A lot of it was validation code as I wanted to make the site as secure as 
possible. Below is a very small snippet showing the interaction with the database. 

{% highlight ruby %}

$command = "select postId from ".$table_name;
$result = mysql_query($command);
while ($data = mysql_fetch_object($result))
{
	print "<TR><TD><a href=?id=".$data->postId.">Blog ".$data->postId."</a></TD><br/>";
}
print "<br/><br/>";
mysql_close($db);
print "<div class = blog_entry>";
include("pointer.php"); 
print "</div>";

{% endhighlight %}

<br/>

I did not use a lot of CSS for the site. The reason being that this way all the focus would remain on the 
user entries.

####See it Live?

Unfortunately it is not possible to see the end product live at the moment since I don't have a webhost account.
All development was done locally using MAMP. I will try and upload screenshots if they are requested
in the future.
