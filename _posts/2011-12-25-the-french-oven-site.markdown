I created this website from scratch: I started with laying out the design, then coding the website and setting up the web host and domain name. 
I also used photoshop for editing all the photos of the cakes in order to make all the display photos consistent with 
each other and creating the header etc. 
I communicated with the client mostly via email and they were happy with the end product. I still 
manage the website and do any content updates that the client requires. 
Please visit the site:
