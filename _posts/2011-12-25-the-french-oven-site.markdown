title: The French Oven site
excerpt: I created this website from scratch and manage it
---

I created this website from scratch. From coming up with the design, to coding the html and css. 
I also edited all the photos of the cakes in order to make all the display photos consistent with 
each other. 

I communicated with the client mostly via email and they were happy with the end product. I still 
manage the website and do any content updates that the client requires. 

Please visit the site to see the end result of my work:
