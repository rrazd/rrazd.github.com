title: Portfolio site
excerpt: You cannot underestimate the power of static sites.
---

This site is a place to display my software portfolio. It was created because whenever I had interviews
the recruiters always indicated that it was beneficial to have concrete examples of past projects. 
There have been plenty of versions of portfolio sites that I have made. Most were flashy with a lot of 
design elements and cool features. However, in the end I realized that I much preferred a very minimalistic
and simple interface, that focused more on the content.
I decided to use the Jekyll static site generator. I had heard good things about it and by using it I could
host this site from GitHub! Of course, there was also the fact that I felt much cooler using terminal to 
simply type, "git init" then  "add ." then "git commit -m updated" then "git push origin master". Within
a few seconds my code appeared on git and the updates were reflected on this website! 
<br/> 
I built everything from scratch just because I find that more interesting, however its not everyone's cup
of tea. In most situations I would recommend using <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/"> Octopress Framework</a>
to set up a Jekyll blog. 
<br/>
The hardest part about reinventing my portfolio site was adding the CSS design elements as I tend to be a 
perfectionist and making sure all elements appeared relatively the same in all browsers, screen size/resolutions
was a bit cumbersome. I would recommend using a pre-made CSS style sheets. If your aptitude in designing and art
is not good then it will save you time and frustration and your site will probably look nicer than it would have
if you had spent hours writing custom CSS (speaking from personal experience).

Although there is much still to do to improve this site, the lack of the hours in the day prevent me from 
working more on it. For now it functions as it should and serves its main purpose: to display a description of
my past projects along with any links to them or screenshots of them.
