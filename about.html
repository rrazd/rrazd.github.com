   		<h3>Hobbies</h3>
   		<p>
   			I enjoy playing almost all sports, although I prefer racquet sports the most. I really like reading
   			both fiction and non fiction, I particularly enjoy the fantasy and science fiction genre! I am a bit of an Apple fan, although I try to keep an open mind when it comes to buying gadgets and gizmos (sadly I usually fail at this and end up heading to the Apple Store in the end).
