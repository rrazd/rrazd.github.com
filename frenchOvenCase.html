				The French Oven is  a bakery that sells frozen baked goods. They specialize in both custom orders and large scale production. They are known for their colorful sweet frosting and whimsical yet professional designs. The bakery wanted to increase their custom order business and explore ecommerce. They wanted a visualization of what a modern, elegant ecommerce website would look like.

				Competitive Analysis was performed to assess other successful ecommerce bakery site's <b>information architecture</b>. One that really stood out was <a href="https://mahzedahrbakery.com">Mahzedahr Bakery</a> - for its usage of large high quality product images, intuitive navigation, well placed cart icon and simple checkout process. Examining other award winning ecommerce websites and reading <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/62391-do-bigger-images-mean-improved-conversion-rates-three-case-studies#i.ysms4792odqnud">case studies</a> highlighted the importance of key factors such as high-resolution zoomable photos.<br/><br/>
				The client was asked to provide information about their customer demographics. Moreover, their existing website's analytics data was examined.

				User stories were used to define requirements and ensured that the user was always at the center of any decisions during the design and development process:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>As a user, I want to browse products</li><br/>
				<li>As a user, I want to view details about a specific product</li><br/>
				<li>As a user, I want to view ratings and reviews for a product</li><br/>
				<li>As a user, I want to add a product to my cart</li><br/>
				<li>As a user, I want to pay for my items with a credit card, Amazon Payments or PayPal</li><br/>
				<li>As a user, I want to sign up for an account</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				User stories were used to create user flows. A sample preliminary user flow sketch is seen below for the login use case (the underlined text represents what the user sees and below that is the corresponding user action):

			 	Low fidelity reponsive wireframes were created in Sketch for the primary pages of the site, based on user stories and user flows.
			 	InVision was used to assemble the wireframes into a clickable prototype, which became the main way to share project milestones with the client. Below are some of the prototypes that were created:

			 	A style guide was created based on colors commonly found in cake frosting. Furthermore the logo was redesigned. Two different logo variations were designed and feedback was gathered from users on which one was more effective:
