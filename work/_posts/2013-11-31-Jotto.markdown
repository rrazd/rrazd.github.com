######Java Swing Application: Model View Controller

This project involved working with Java Swing, strictly adhering to the MVC design pattern and understanding various layouts to code an app with a dynamic layout. 

What did creating a dynamic layout involve? (no GUI design tool used) 

-  re-allocate space for widgets
-  adjust location and size of widgets
-  change visibility, look, and/or feel of widgets

Anyone can use a GUI design tool, but that does not mean that they understand what is going on under the hood! I believe that the best way to actually learn a new programming language or software is to do things the hard way first a.k.a manually. This way one understands the important concepts, only then should automation and external plugins/libraries be applied to speed up development. 

The Model-View-Controller architecture that was used in this project grouped the View and Controller under the same class. However the Model was kept completely separate.  

You should keep the following in mind when implementing MVC:

-  Model: manages the data and its manipulation
-  View: manages the presentation of the data 
-  Controller: manages the user interaction
