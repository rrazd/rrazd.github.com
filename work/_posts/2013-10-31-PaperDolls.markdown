######Direct Manipulation

I learnt a lot about direct manipulation while developing a Java application that allowed the user to manipulate the parts of a paper doll via the mouse. You might be wondering, what is direct manipulation? Well, direct manipulation is an interaction style with some digital device. We often employ direct manipulation when using an iPad where we swipe our finger across the screen to flip a page and drag our hand down in order to move a page down. 

One of the goals of this application was to explore the best the interaction mechanism such that the user would be able to rotate and stretch body parts without having to read any instructions. Thus the interaction mechanism has to be easily discoverable. 

This project involved working with **Java 2D API, sprites, scene graphs and affine transforms.** Furthermore a **scripting infrastructure** was included.This allowed one to create a demo script that could be played back. Thus one could record the dragging of the doll's arms and play this back, simulating a waving motion. 

Certain cool features of the application include facial animation when the user drags the head sideways!

The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/rrazd/PaperDoll">here</a>.
