######Looking back at the past

This site is a place to display my software portfolio. 
There have been plenty of "portfolio site" versions that have come to pass. A lot of tinkering and inspirational
sites have led me to creating the current version. A version that I was particularly happy with is seen below.

######Jekyll to the rescue

I decided to use the Jekyll static site generator. I had heard good things about it and by using it I could
host this site from GitHub! Of course, there was also the fact that I felt much cooler using the terminal in order to get my website's code to update on GitHub and these updates to be reflected in the site within seconds! 

```html
git init  
add .  
git commit -m 'updated' 
git push origin master
```
