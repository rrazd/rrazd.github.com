				The client wanted a design of a <b>mobile application for iOS</b> that allows users to find food trucks near them, view a menu and select items for purchase and checkout. A well-designed solution for mobile checkout hasn't been created yet for the food truck industry, making this an exciting and novel project.

				<li>As a user, I want to view food trucks near me on a map</li><br/>
				<li>As a user, I want to select a truck, view details, and see a food menu</li><br/>
				<li>As a user, I want to create an account and view recent transactions</li><br/>
				<li>As a user, I want to choose items to purchase and pay for them using my phone</li><br/>
				<li>As a user, I want to rate and review a food truck, and view other ratings and reviews</li><br/>
