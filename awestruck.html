				<li>As a user, I want to select a truck, view details, and see a menu</li><br/>
				<li>As a user, I want to create an account and view recent transactions</li><br/>
				<li>As a user, I want to choose items to purchase and pay for them using my phone</li><br/>
				<li>As a user, I want to rate and review a food truck, and view other ratings and reviews</li><br/>
