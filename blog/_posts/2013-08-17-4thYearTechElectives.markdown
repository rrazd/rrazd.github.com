I thought to write a post on electives I took in 4th Year. Up until 3B students are for the most part assigned mandatory engineering courses. However, in the 4A and 4B terms, you can choose all the engineering courses you want to do. For my 4A term I chose to do ECE 452 (Software Design and Architecture) and ECE 455 (Embedded Software).

######ECE 452: Software Design and Architecture 
ECE 452 is cross-listed as CS 446. The objective of the course is to introduce students to the software design process and its models. I took the course during a spring term, Professor Igor Ivkovic taught the course. *I found this course extremely interesting and helpful.* The main focus of the course is a software project where we get to apply all that we have learnt in the course (software design process, software architecture, design strategies, design assessment, design quality assurance and verification). Our professor offered us a great deal of flexibility in terms of what kind of technology we wanted to use and what kind of application we wanted to build. The only restrictions were essentially that one should be able to apply GoF design patterns and describe the architecture/use cases of the project for design documents. 
Projects that people have completed for this course include:
<ul>
<li> Software for a mobile device </li>
<li> Software embedded into a hardware platform </li>
<li> Web-based applications </li>
<li> Desktop applications </li>
</ul>

The course project is usually done in groups of 4 and it is an excellent way to learn how to work with others and improve on some essential 'soft skills.' However, I do know some people who chose to work alone and did very well in the project.
If you choose to work alone then you should be prepared to do more work and give up the opportunity to learn new and interesting things about from your team members. The flip side of working in a group is arranging a common time to meet. I know some groups that had problems setting a meeting time and getting other members of the group to participate. I found the grading for the project was quite leniant and it was easy to do well if you read the lecture slides or attended lectures regularly. Similarly the midterm and final exam were extremely fair.  

*Grading: midterm, final exam and a term project*

######ECE 455: Embedded Software
I took this couse during a spring term, the professor was Sebastian Fischmeister. I had expected this to be a tough course. I was prepared to spend a long time struggling with the labs. However, it turned out that my expectations were misguided. I found the labs to not be too difficult and I did really well on them without having to put in a lot of time. The labs focused a lot on timing and getting the timing of certain events correct. In total there were 5 labs done using C programming; they were very well organized. The labs were done online; the student could compile and deploy the code onto STM32F405 microcontrollers located in a lab room somewhere in the university. A dashboard then showed the outcomes of the runs. This was really great as it allowed students to complete the labs from the convenience of their homes, no tool chain setup was needed and we did not have to worry about any wiring issues. A picture of the coding environment is shown below:

Furthermore, the theoretical part of the course was not too hard to grasp. The lectures were quite helpful and I would definitely recommend going to them. There were two quizzes and no midterm. The quizzes were very simple and all the questions on them were based on questions already covered in the tutorials. On the other hand, the final exam was not easy and most people seemed to find it very challenging. 

*Grading: best of 2 quizzes, final exam and 5 labs*
