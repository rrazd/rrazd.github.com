Everything comes to an end. This has never been clearer to me than when I finished my last Engineering exam of undergrad. It feels just like yesterday that I was sitting (often confused) in lectures, agonizing over assignments and spending countless hours trying to understand electronic circuits. At those times, graduation seemed like a far off thought, an idea I could barely grasp. 

Although I am super excited to be closing the Engineering textbooks (for now), the reality of entering the 'real world' is quite daunting. No more crazy sleeping patterns, microwave meals, shared apartments, exam cramming and labs! There are undoubtedly many differences in the world of academia and industry and the transition will be intriguing. In university, the pursuit of knowledge can sometimes be a solitary effort. However, I have learnt from my internships that in industry teamwork is essential. These post-university changes usher in a new chapter of my life that I am sure will be challenging and fun. 

There are many different types of jobs a Computer Engineering graduate can apply for. At a high level there are two categories: hardware and software. I found that the software job market was quite saturated and there was a lot of competition for the really good jobs. I don't have too much experience with hardware job interviews but from what I have heard they are more related to 2nd - 4th year Computer Engineering courses. On the other hand, the algorithm puzzles/coding questions asked for software development jobs are not really the types of problems that are explicitly covered in any of the engineering courses (self studying is needed)!
