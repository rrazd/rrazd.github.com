<p>Even though I am now finishing up my undergrad in Engineering, I still recall debating which university to choose to go to back in grade 12. I applied to Queens Engineering, Queens’s School of Business, University of Toronto (U of T) Engineering and Waterloo Math and Business (double degree) and Waterloo Computer Engineering. I got into all these programs however I was quite unsure which one was right for me. In the end, I decided that Computer Engineering sounded the most challenging and exciting, now I had to decide if I wanted to go to U of T or University of Waterloo.</p>
###### U of T acceptance
<p>I went to a high school in downtown Toronto and I had visited U of T's campus many times. I had even spent some time at their libraries in order to finish up some research papers. My acceptance to U of T Engineering arrived in the middle of grade 12. Soon after that, I registered for an engineering tour for prospective students. However, I was not very impressed by the campus. The buildings were scattered around city and there did not seem to be a campus 'atmosphere' that I wanted. Furthermore, the lecture hall that the introduction was held at was massive. I had heard that U of T was a big university with big classes in first year and the big lecture hall emphasized this fact. This was not appealing to me seeing as I knew I felt more comfortable in smaller classes where I was acquainted to most of students.</p>
###### University of Waterloo acceptance
<p>My acceptance letter to the University of Waterloo Computer Engineering arrived a week after U of T's acceptance. My tour of the university left me with a stellar impression. During my visit there were Professor's who were willing to talk to prospective Engineering students. There were also many workshops held by upper year students to share their wisdom. Additionally, all the Engineering buildings were relatively close together on campus and it actually 'felt' like a university campus unlike U of T. In fact Waterloo is very much a University town. Students can use the city's buses for free and are given discounts in many grocery stores and restaurants.</p>   
<p>What’s more, Waterloo did not have a general first year for Engineering. You straightaway choose which branch of engineering you wanted to do. This was great for me since I was already set on doing Computer Engineering.</p>
###### University of Waterloo Main Advantage
<p>Furthermore, unlike U of T, Waterloo had a <b>mandatory co-op program</b> for Engineering. I knew that in Engineering, hands-on experience is extremely important; after all, it takes a whole other skill set to be able to apply what you have learnt as opposed to only doing theoretical problems and reading a textbook. Now that I have done many co-op terms I can confirm that doing internships is a phenomenal experience. By the time you graduate, you have a ton of things you can include in your resume. You also have some amazing contacts and references. I personally have learn a lot about what kind of jobs I want to do and most importantly, what kind of jobs I want to avoid upon graduation. The co-op program has also made the University of Waterloo a well-known and respected institution in the Silicon Valley and other key tech locations. Many Computer Engineering students get a co-op job at companies such as Facebook, Apple, RIM and Google. The major banks in downtown Toronto and firms such as Morgan Stanley also hire many students. Moreover, for those students who are interested in starting up their own businesses, the co-op program offers a chance to do so without having to drop out of university.</p>
<p>In sum, due to all the aforementioned reasons, the University of Waterloo was the right choice for me.</p>
