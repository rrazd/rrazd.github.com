				NexJ Connected Wellness is a patient-facing, digital platform for cloud-based population health management. Its goal is to empower patients to actively participate in managing their own health and wellness. <br/>
				The client wanted to build a web application that had a sleek UI and took advantage of modern best practices and open source ecosystems.<br/> 
				My role was of a frontend developer. This role comprised of adhering and enforcing good UX practices. <b>Google Material Design Guidelines</b> were closely studied and used as a primary reference when making design decisions; although at times it was necessary to stray from the guidelines. At these times, my knowledge of UX/UI design was invaluable.<br/> I worked within a small team of developers, designers and QA's. The developers <b>worked collaboratively with the designers to influence key design decisions</b> based on the amount of developer time required, how beneficial the client would find a particular feature/design and how well the change would fit into the existing user flow.

				UX research was conducted by developing and examining <b>user surveys and personas</b>: most users of the application were found to be 50+ in age. This influenced a lot of UX/UI decisions such as the amount of padding needed for buttons and the text size on desktop and mobile. It also affected other UX decisions. For instance, lack of familiarity with trending UX interactions meant we had to adopt well established visual design patterns. The user demographic affected our design palette, for instance we needed to ensure that there was sufficient contrast (light background color, dark font color) due to increased likelihood of some visual impairments in our older audience etc.<br/>
				A lot of <b>sketches were made</b> during the UX brainstorming and research phase related to data visualization (such as displaying the number of steps a user has walked in a given time period). A considerable amount of work was done to understand the type of data that was being generated by digital health devices and to understand what aspects of that data were most useful. Our goal for visualizing information was to ensure that the information could be interpreted ‘at a glance’. Below is a sketch I made for dealing with thresholds:

				<b>Competitive Analysis</b> was performed on similar products and features such as <a href="https://www.healthtap.com/">HealthTap</a> and Microsoft Health Vault.

				IBM Watson is a cognitive system that provides many services via its api's. I gave many presentations to senior management based on my competitive analysis of IBM Watson's features and how companies are presently using them. This helped influence key business decisions. This role helped refine my research, analysis, presentation and communication skills.<br/>
				Sample slides can be seen below:

			<div class="heading">1) User registration:</div>
			<p>
				I built the UI for this as well as some backend in javascript and wrote mongo db queries.<br/>
				This project involved worked with UX to create the design and develop the whole registration feature. Mobile friendly, readable and robust designs were implemented.

			<div class="heading">2) Email Templates:</div>
			<p>
				I created email templates and ensured that they render correctly on all supported browsers and devices. In addition, I enforced emails to use the correct branding and strings based on the position and status of the sender/receiver.
			</p>
			<div class="heading">3) Styling:</div>
			<p>
				I helped make the application mobile compatible by adding media queries and fixing UI bugs related to rendering on different mobile browsers. For instance, I fixed numerous IE9, Safari and Android stock browser related bugs. Below is an image of the application running on mobile:

			<div class="heading">4) Creating New Views:</div>
			<p>
				View consists of two parts: view and renderer. The view provides the semantic API for developers. The renderer augments a particular view and defines how the view is rendered and how events are handled given a particular platform. One of my key roles as a developer was to create new views based on designs provided. The designs were a result of collaborations and meetings with the designers and Product Manager's.

			 	I helped out a lot with testing newly developed features both for functionality and UI/UX. This included writing and filling out test cases and working with designers to bring up any UI/UX issues.
