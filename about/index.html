<p>I like <b>front end</b> and <b>back end</b> web application development. I have done many internships working as a software developer seeing as my university has a mandatory co op program for Computer Engineering.</p>


<p>I have worked at <a href="http://us.blackberry.com/">Research In Motion</a>, <a href="http://www.sap.com/index.epx">SAP</a>, <a href="http://www.bmo.com/home">Bank of Montreal</a> and the <a href="http://www.waterloo.ca/">City of Waterloo</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to discuss any of my past projects then you can <a href="http://rrazd.github.io/contact/">contact</a> me! If you are looking to hire a software developer and wish to set up an interview then please note that I will be graduating in the winter of 2014.</p>
