front page:
- is the bright green background of awestruck needed? it looks out of place
- if i spam clicks on one of the sections in the header, im unable to scroll for a few seconds. it just gets stuck and jitters
- with JS disabled
	- footer links are broken. try have a text fallback
	- explore case button on main carousel is very tall and not vertically centred
- not sure if its intention, but when the top bar fades in, the bottom border appears first. when it fades out, it disappears at the same time as the rest of it
- in FF when i hover over the images for the first time, they flicker briefly
- in IE when i mouse out of the images, the "explore" text kind of flickers black and blue
	- has 1px white border at the bottom

all case pages:
- js error upon load Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getAttribute' of null
- some of the pages just say generic things like "UX and Front End Development" on the hero banner so i don't know what i clicked on. most of the pages look almost identical because they have the same banner image. each page should look unique and should really highlight the designs you created for that project. show them off! it's what people visit these pages to see. there should be some interesting content visible without havign to scroll at all


french oven:
- i feel like the finished product should be more visible at the top. i need to scroll all the way down to get to the important part
- "web site of their business" remove "of their business"
- "Competitive Analysis was performed to assess how other successful ecommerce bakery site's information architecture." grammar. remove "how"?
- "Decisions on which features should be included and emphasized were affected by who the primary audience was projected to be." i dont think this sentence is needed
- the user story image is kind of pixelated and out of place. redraw it on the computer with something digital
- the logos are kind of pixelated, especially the circle on the black & white ones. try adjust quality settings when you resize
- 2 of the same logo, but one has a box around it?
- "Using this style guide the design phase was completed" i think it needs a comma after guide
- conclusion section suddenly switches to first person ("i did...")
- is there a full res mockup i can see anywhere? all of the final shots are pretty small
- all of the text links to dribble could be made fancier visually and less verbose
- some of the process description seems a bit dull. i feel like what people are coming to this page for is the final results


BlocBox:
- all of the final screenshots are small and buried at the bottom in a big dump. these are what i want to be coming to this page to look for. they should be clickable to zoom and should have some sort of captions to help me navigate what i'm looking at, not just a list of screenshots. this is the main content you want to highlight on this page
- broken image http://rrazd.github.io/images/blocBoxCase/Balsamiq.jpg
- uses first person while french oven didnt
- is defining SaaS necessary? not sure
- "allows people to collect information and store it in a single place" sounds very generic. what kind of info?
- "links to websites" just say links
- is it possible to recreate the SWOT image with a sans serif font? serif looks weird
- SWOT threats: "companies" not "company's"
- "If they use social network logins to sign up for websites their age and where they live" broken grammar?
- "The results were aggregated into an excel file:" excel should be capitalized but that's not excel in the screenshot
	- crop out the URL (privacy?)
- resizing of the responses image makes it really sharp and hard to read
- dont think you need screenshots of both the spreadhseet and graph
- "Conclusions could easily be extracted by analyzing the graphs." delete this. should never state something is obvious
- larry p ( :) ) image: "difficulty recalling passwords if try to use..." weird grammar
- "helped clarify the pages needed to be wireframed and designed" "needing" or "that needed"
- user flow and sitemap images are impossible to read (too small)
- "The design guide included the logo that was designed in Illustrator. In order to create the logo a mindmap was created to visualize related concepts and words that would influence the logo. Many different logos were created and compared:" you use the word create too many times here
- "Based on the prototypes created and the design guide the following homepage was designed:" comma after guide
- "the following designs were replaced the previous ones" grammar
- link to what the five seconds and nav flow tests are
- "This was lower than expected and indicated further improvement was needed." makes it sounds like the completion time was low (would be a good thing)
- " prototyping and design phases the client" comma after phases
- "progress, this ensured" semicolon?


awestruck:
- again, put your finished work at the top and make it easy to zoom in on and navigate. 90% of people only want to see this
- "Since this is an iPhone application the" comma after application
- "Since this is an iPhone application the iOS Human Interface Guidelines were reviewed before beginning any design work" you should say it was designed to conform
- you should put the logo design up front and centre at the top of the page. show them off, they look good!
- "Some of the designs made are displayed below, initially the low fidelity prototypes were sketched on paper." should be separate sentences
- the "your order is placed" image is short than the others
   - this one says done but the one beside it says close
- bright green background on http://rrazd.github.io/images/awestruck/phoneView.jpg is way too radioactive :)
- "Certain parts of the finished design were animated, using the Principal application, to provide a deeper level of clarity to the stakeholders:" phrasing sounds weird. and i think in other places you bolded application names
- "Marvel prototypes were created" what are marvel prototypes? what kind of feedback did you get?
- the conclusion should be broken up into multiple sentences



wedding site:
- "The client wanted a wedding website to be..." sounds kind of weird when the client is you!
- capitalize javascript
- capitalize indian
- "Development was done by myself and another developer" should just say sandeep
- git isn't an acronym
- put the link to the live site and screenshots at the top
- crop out your bookmarks from the screenshots
- this screenshot is one big image while other pages have small individual ones
- screenshots should be zoomable
- "Testing was done in both landscape and portrait orientation" dont need to say this, should be obvious
- "speed was not what we wanted it to be" switches to first person
- "Using the smallest uniquely identifiable CSS selector" did this really have an effect on page speed?
- conclusion sounds weird if you gave the site to yourselves :)



nexj:
- don't think you should call them the client if they were your employer
- "that had a sleek UI and took advantage of modern best practices" doesn't tell me much because it should go without saying
- "My role was of a frontend developer" sounds weird
- "although at times it was necessary to stray from the guidelines" say why
- "decisions such as the amount of padding needed for buttons and the text size on desktop and mobile." doesn't tell me the reasoning behind the decision
- "in our older audience etc." remove etc
- "Below is a sketch I made for dealing with thresholds" tell me more about what thresholds are and what this picture shows. more mixing of first person writing
- "via its api's" capitalize API, no apostrophe
- doesn't really say how the watson stuff relates
- "backend in javascript and wrote mongo db queries." capitalize js and mongo db

- "I enforced emails" say something like "styled"
- "Android stock browser related" just say "Android Browser"
- screenshots up top
- mixed capitalization of headers in the "development" section
- "View consists of two parts: view and renderer." unneeded detail here. describe the kinds of views you created. pcitures?
- "Product Manager's" no apostrophe
- "I helped out a lot" first person. say "Assisted with" instead. skip "a lot"
- here you say UI/UX but other places say UX/UI


portfolio:
- zoomable images
- "The main goal of my current portfolio website was to create a clean and professional design that focused on my projects." seems unnecessary to state this
- remove "Competitive Review:" at start of paragraph
- "designs wertr built" typo
- this page uses first person text
- "I knew that I wanted to incorporate the mountains, which represented my love for the outdoors and my favorite landscape, into my logo." too many commas
- link to  Jekyll is broken
- this page links to 3rd party products but some of the others dont
- conclusion feels unnecessary



healthy eating:
- "amount of calorie" plural
- get rid of "furthermore"
- "term of eating healthy" plural
- "To create the actual application Google Web Toolkit" bold the name. Don't say "actual application"
- bold java and eclipse
