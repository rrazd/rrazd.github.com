 PHP

yourdomain.userworld.com

mysql -h sql.useractive.com -p -u yourlogin yourlogin

************
The -h flag tells MySQL to read all the databases off a separate server--in your case, instead of cold.useractive.com, you use the OST database server, sql.useractive.com--because that's where your database resides.

The -p flag tells mysql to prompt for a password, so you can log in safely.

The -u flag tells mysql to log in the user specified by yourlogin.

Finally, the last yourlogin parameter specifies the default database to use--in your case, we created your database name to be the same as your own Sandbox login. In the later course, you might create a database with any name you wish.
