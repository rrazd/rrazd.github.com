	</header>

	<p>If you are going into Computer Engineering I would strongly recommend that you accumulate some experience programming in Java or C#. In first year (1A term) there is an <b>Introduction to Programming course (ECE 150)</b> offered by the university. However, I found this course to be very unhelpful as a novice programmer at the time. This was because it was slightly overwhelming having to learn all the main programming concepts in the span of 4 months along with studying for 4 other engineering courses and adjusting to life at university. Going into computer engineering I really had no idea what programming was. On the first day of classes I wrote the obligatory Hello World program in C#:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kr">public</span> <span class="kr">class</span> <span class="nx">Hello1</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="kr">public</span> <span class="kr">static</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nx">Main</span><span class="p">()</span>
   <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="nx">System</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
   <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><figurecaption>See some code samples from the course by checking out a former Teaching Assistant&#39;s blog on the course:<a href="http://nicholasarmstrong.com/2009/09/ece-150-programming-samples/"> here</a></figurecaption></p>

<p>Needless to say, I was extremely unprepared and rather clueless. I should have taken some sort of course on the subject in high school however computer science was hardly mentioned in the all-girls private school that I attended in Toronto.</p> 

<p>I did the IB Diploma Programme in high school. I took higher level Chemistry, English and History and standard level Math, Physics and Spanish. I believe that IB does have some Computer Science courses however these were not offered at my school.</p>

<p>The three month break that I had after my high school graduation and the start of university consisted of spending time outdoors and travelling around Canada. This was awesome, however looking back I would suggest that you pick up an Introduction to Java textbook and read through it. This will make life a lot easier once you start university. Programming is not that hard to learn by yourself. Often the professors for the Introduction to Programming course read straight off of the lecture slides and the professor that my class had was painfully monotonous. As a result I ended up having to learn most of the material by myself anyways.</p> 

<p>Another problem with the Introduction to Programming course is that three quarters of the class already know programming quite well. They end up being frustrated and bored with the course since they are learning nothing knew. The professors are in a complicated position because they have to somehow cater to students who have little to no knowledge of programming and also try to keep the intermediate and advanced programmers awake. In consequence, more often than not, the professors start to talk about concepts beyond the beginner level, leaving the newbie programmers confused.</p>

<p>The labs for this course consisted of some programming projects. The first two projects were very easy, even for the amateur programmer. However the difficulty level for all subsequent projects increased exponentially. What started out as simple Hello World type lab exercises soon morphed into implementing the binary search algorithm and understanding topics such as polymorphism and inheritence. I remember spending many days toiling over them. There is a lot of help available from Teaching Assistants (TA), however sometimes their comments end up causing more confusion. This is because they might have a totally different approach to solving the problem at hand and they might not fully understand your plan to tackle the problem. Additionally, the TA's can only help you to a certain degree when it comes to debugging your code.</p>

<p>All in all, I think the university should adopt that same approach for Computer Engineering as they do for Software Engineering: <b>they should really encourage incoming students to have some programming experience.</b></p>
