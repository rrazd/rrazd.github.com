	</header>

	<p>Even though I am now finishing up my undergrad in Engineering, I still recall debating which university to choose to go to back in grade 12. I applied to Queens Engineering, Queens’s School of Business, University of Toronto (U of T) Engineering, Waterloo Math and Business (double degree) and Waterloo Computer Engineering. I got into all these programs however I was quite unsure which one was right for me. In the end, I decided that Computer Engineering sounded the most challenging and exciting, now I had to decide if I wanted to go to U of T or University of Waterloo.</p>

<h6>U of T acceptance</h6>

<p>I went to a high school in downtown Toronto and I had visited U of T's campus many times. I had even spent some time at their libraries in order to finish up some research papers. My acceptance to U of T Engineering arrived in the middle of grade 12. Soon after that, I registered for an engineering tour for prospective students. However, I was not very impressed by the campus. The buildings were scattered around city and there did not seem to be a campus 'atmosphere' that I wanted. Furthermore, the lecture hall that the introduction was held at was huge. I had heard that U of T was a massive university with big classes in first year and the large lecture hall emphasized this fact. This was not appealing to me seeing as I knew I felt much more comfortable in smaller classes where I was acquainted with most of the computer engineering students.
Moreover, I knew that most students at U of T were commuters. If I went to U of T, I too would be a commuter. This was not something I wanted seeing as I preferred to live on campus close to the lecture halls and other university facilities.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, U of T had the prestige factor going for it. U of T is an older and more established institution. Also, I found that many people outside of Canada seemed more familiar with U of T and less so with the University of Waterloo.</p>

<h6>University of Waterloo acceptance</h6>

<p>My acceptance letter to the University of Waterloo Computer Engineering arrived a week after U of T's acceptance. My tour of the university left me with a stellar impression. During my visit there were Professor's who were willing to talk to prospective Engineering students. There were also many workshops held by upper year students to share their wisdom. Additionally, all the Engineering buildings were relatively close together on campus and it actually 'felt' like a university campus unlike U of T. In fact Waterloo is very much a University town. Students can use the city's buses for free and are given discounts in many grocery stores and restaurants.</p>   

<p>What’s more, the University of Waterloo does not have a general first year for Engineering. You can straightaway choose which branch of engineering you wanted to do. This was great for me since I was already set on doing Computer Engineering. Nevertheless the first year of Computer Engineering has courses such as General Chemistry and Physics 101. So if you realize that you have made the wrong decision regarding choosing to do Computer Engineering then switching to another branch such as Management Engineering or even Chemical Engineering can usually be arranged without too much hassle.</p>

<h6>University of Waterloo Main Advantage</h6>

<p>Furthermore, unlike U of T, Waterloo had a <b>mandatory co-op program</b> for Engineering. I knew that in Engineering, hands-on experience is extremely important; after all, it takes a whole other skill set to be able to apply what you have learnt as opposed to only doing theoretical problems and reading a textbook. Now that I have done many co-op terms I can confirm that doing internships is a phenomenal experience. By the time you graduate, you have a ton of things you can include in your resume. You also have some amazing contacts and references. I personally have learnt a lot about what kind of jobs I want to do and most importantly, what kind of jobs I want to avoid upon graduation. The co-op program has also made the University of Waterloo a well-known and respected institution in the Silicon Valley and other key tech locations. Many Computer Engineering students get a co-op job at companies such as Facebook, Apple, Blackberry and Google. The major banks in downtown Toronto and firms such as Morgan Stanley also hire many students. Moreover, for those students who are interested in starting up their own businesses, the co-op program offers a chance to do so without having to drop out of university.</p>

<p>In addition, thanks to the co-op program I was able to pay for all my school fees without having to borrow any money. The co-op program essentially enabled me to pay for all my university expenses including off campus housing/general living expenses.</p>

<p>In sum, due to all the aforementioned reasons, the University of Waterloo was the right choice for me.</p> 

<p>Lastly, I am frequently asked about the employment rate and salaries for the co-op program. I know that for Computer Engineering the employment rate is very high (of course this is subject to change according to the economy, but even when the economy was rough in the past few years almost all students in my class (that I know of) eventually found a decent job. The interview process can seem a little daunting and tough in first year. It is a good idea to get your resume reviewed by some upper year student, this will <i>really</i> help you get more interviews because they know what employers are looking for. More interviews = higher probability of being employed (this is especially true in first year). As for salaries, the amount really varies. Usually the further you are in your degree the more you will be paid. Some companies pay more than others. Canadian startups pay quite little however you gain a lot more experience as compared to working for a big bank.</p>

<p>Feel free to comment below if you have any other questions regarding Engineering at the University of Waterloo.</p>
