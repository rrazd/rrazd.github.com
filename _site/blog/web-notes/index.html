<h4>The Start of Something New</h4>

<p>Quite recently I had the urge to create something. I gave myself a limit of three days so as to
complete a project in a time sensitive environment. I knew that in order to pull of this project
I had to make a plan: a visual site map is quick to make, it can be fairly detailed yet
I kept mine simple so that it would be easy to change if need be.</p>

<br/>


<h4>A Brief Overview of the End Product</h4>

<p>To create the website I used PHP + SQL. I wanted to refine my skills in these two topics and during the
arduous journey that was the process of creating this website, I learn more that a few things! It&rsquo;s important
to note that the main objective was to learn. If I had wanted to create the most feature rich website in very little
time I would have used a framework instead.
I decided to make a website where a user could login to their own webspace. Once in, they have the option of:</p>

<br/>


<h4>1. Jotting down any quick reminders, ideas and notes. These entries are posted after the user clicks &ldquo;Submit&rdquo;</h4>

<br/>


<h4>2. Emailing and share user login details with friends so that people can comment on the entries</h4>

<br/>


<h4>3. Controlling who can sign-in to the webspace in order to prevent any abuse, by banning a guest&rsquo;s IP</h4>

<br/>


<h4>4. Basic SQL injection protection during the login process</h4>

<br/>


<h4>5. A minimal and sleek display of all previous entries, sorted according to date.</h4>

<br/>


<h4>6. A banner displaying an active countdown to the end of the current month.</h4>

<br/>


<br/>


<h4>The Best Part</h4>

<p>The best part was writing out the PHP logic and figuring out how to implement my ideas into code and in turn into
reality! The code wasn&rsquo;t too complex. A lot of it was validation code as I wanted to make the site as secure as
possible. Below is a very small snippet showing the interaction with the database.</p>

<br/>


<p>I did not use a lot of CSS for the site. The reason being that this way all the focus would remain on the
user entries.</p>

<br/>


<h4>See it Live?</h4>

<p>Unfortunately it is not possible to see the end product live at the moment since I don&rsquo;t have a webhost account.
All development was done locally using MAMP. I will try and upload screenshots if they are requested
in the future.</p>

<p>Any feedback and suggestions are welcome. Please email me by clicking the Contact tab at the top.</p>
