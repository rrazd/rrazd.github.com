<h4>The Start of Something New</h4>

<p>Quite recently I had the urge to create something. I gave myself a limit of three days so as to
complete a project in a time sensitive environment. I knew that in order to pull of this project
I had to make a plan: a visual site map is quick to make, it can be fairly detailed yet
I kept mine simple so that it would be easy to change if need be.</p>

<br/>


<h4>A Brief Overview of the End Product</h4>

<p>To create the website I used PHP + SQL. I wanted to refine my skills in these two areas and during the
rewarding journey of creating the website, I learnt a lot of new things! It&rsquo;s important
to note that the main objective was to LEARN! If I had wanted to create the most feature rich website in very little
time, I would have used a framework.
The end product was a website where a user could login to their own webspace. Once in, they had the option of:</p>

<br/>


<h4>1. Jotting down any quick reminders, ideas and notes. These entries are posted after the user clicks &ldquo;Submit&rdquo;</h4>

<br/>


<h4>2. Basic SQL injection protection during the login process</h4>

<br/>


<h4>3. A minimal and sleek display of all previous entries, sorted according to date.</h4>

<br/>


<h4>4. A banner displaying an active countdown to the end of the current month.</h4>

<br/>


<br/>


<h4>The Best Part</h4>

<p>The best part was writing out the PHP logic and figuring out how to implement my ideas into code and in turn into
reality!</p>

<br/>




<br/>


<p>I did not use a lot of CSS for the site. The reason being that this way all the focus would remain on the
user entries.</p>
